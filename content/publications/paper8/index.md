##### Abstract

In this paper, I examine the support of German businesses—especially exporters—for the Economic and Monetary Union before 1999. I argue that the support of the German export sector for the EMU depends crucially on its implications for export competitiveness. If exporters conclude that the EMU will improve their competitive position, they will likely support monetary integration. In contrast, other business actors should be more skeptical about the prospects of a European currency union. I therefore expect that the major export enterprises will use their dominant position in the business community to assert their interests. The empirical analysis is based on enterprise surveys and a detailed qualitative study of the role of export interests in Germany’s peak industrial association. I close by discussing how my results provide important insights for various scholarly debates, including the debate on Germany’s role in the Eurozone.
